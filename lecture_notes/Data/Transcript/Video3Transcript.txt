1
00:00:41.035 --> 00:00:45.245
Earlier we saw that cost that is

2
00:00:46.525 --> 00:00:51.165
C is a shorthand version for cost and Q is the quantity.

3
00:00:51.715 --> 00:00:54.485
Cost would change as quantity would change.

4
00:00:55.025 --> 00:00:57.805
We saw that it can be decomposed into two part

5
00:00:59.205 --> 00:01:03.885
explicit cost plus implicit cost.

6
00:01:05.985 --> 00:01:08.485
Now we are going to decompose it slightly differently.

7
00:01:09.425 --> 00:01:13.855
We can write C of Q as

8
00:01:14.745 --> 00:01:18.175
fixed cost plus variable

9
00:01:18.325 --> 00:01:20.375
cost if you pay attention.

10
00:01:20.525 --> 00:01:24.815
Here we, I'm writing C as a function of Q as

11
00:01:25.895 --> 00:01:28.495
Q increases C increases.

12
00:01:30.075 --> 00:01:33.695
So QA change in Q will bring a change in C.

13
00:01:34.355 --> 00:01:36.335
It is written in two parts here.

14
00:01:37.155 --> 00:01:41.845
One part is called fixed cost

15
00:01:44.585 --> 00:01:48.045
and the another part is called variable cost.

16
00:01:49.705 --> 00:01:53.765
If you notice, I'm not writing FC

17
00:01:54.465 --> 00:01:57.125
as a function of Q here.

18
00:01:57.125 --> 00:01:59.805
There is no queue why there is no queue

19
00:02:01.035 --> 00:02:05.965
because fixed cost is something that doesn't change with Q.

20
00:02:06.105 --> 00:02:09.605
So fixed cost I can say can say does not

21
00:02:11.035 --> 00:02:15.545
vary with width Q

22
00:02:16.525 --> 00:02:17.905
and variable cost.

23
00:02:20.175 --> 00:02:24.705
Cost varies with Q

24
00:02:25.165 --> 00:02:27.545
as you choose the output it.

25
00:02:28.655 --> 00:02:33.025
This cost changes for example, let us look at it

26
00:02:33.295 --> 00:02:35.265
that you are producing some widget

27
00:02:38.855 --> 00:02:41.555
And for that you are buying raw material

28
00:02:41.705 --> 00:02:42.795
from different places.

29
00:02:43.735 --> 00:02:46.595
If you are producing 10 units, you will need

30
00:02:47.145 --> 00:02:49.445
some raw material.

31
00:02:49.705 --> 00:02:51.405
If you are producing a hundred unit,

32
00:02:51.825 --> 00:02:54.845
you will lead 10 times more raw material.

33
00:02:55.505 --> 00:02:58.685
So the cost of raw material would change

34
00:02:59.155 --> 00:03:01.085
with the level of output.

35
00:03:01.465 --> 00:03:05.365
So the cost of raw material is going to be a part of

36
00:03:06.205 --> 00:03:07.245
variable cost.

37
00:03:08.665 --> 00:03:12.295
But to manage the so floor

38
00:03:12.425 --> 00:03:14.535
where these visits are being produced,

39
00:03:15.275 --> 00:03:19.655
you will have a manager, whether you are producing 10 units,

40
00:03:20.295 --> 00:03:22.535
a hundred units or a thousand units,

41
00:03:23.195 --> 00:03:26.135
you will have one manager and

42
00:03:26.135 --> 00:03:30.135
therefore the salary paid to this manager is going

43
00:03:30.155 --> 00:03:33.695
to be part of your fixed cost.

44
00:03:34.675 --> 00:03:39.055
It is not changing with the output

45
00:03:39.155 --> 00:03:41.835
as the name suggest, okay?

46
00:03:42.135 --> 00:03:43.515
It should be clear to you.

47
00:03:43.775 --> 00:03:46.515
So fixed cost and variable cost,

48
00:03:47.855 --> 00:03:49.625
okay, it's clear.

49
00:03:50.125 --> 00:03:53.865
Now let us look at the third component. Quasi fixed cost.

50
00:03:54.275 --> 00:03:58.465
First of all, let us understand what does quasi mean.

51
00:03:58.705 --> 00:03:59.945
I would use Hindi term.

52
00:04:00.585 --> 00:04:03.865
Quasi means jsa like

53
00:04:04.885 --> 00:04:08.935
so quasi fixed cost means like a fixed cost.

54
00:04:09.875 --> 00:04:12.975
How it is different from this fixed cost

55
00:04:13.805 --> 00:04:16.335
that if you are not producing anything,

56
00:04:17.075 --> 00:04:18.695
if your output is zero,

57
00:04:19.865 --> 00:04:22.535
quasi fixed cost is going to be zero.

58
00:04:23.475 --> 00:04:26.815
But whether you are producing one unit, two unit three,

59
00:04:26.815 --> 00:04:31.735
unit four unit, it is going to be some positive number

60
00:04:33.435 --> 00:04:38.055
and this number doesn't change with the output.

61
00:04:38.055 --> 00:04:40.335
This number remains the same.

62
00:04:40.755 --> 00:04:45.015
It changes only once when output changes from zero to a

63
00:04:45.535 --> 00:04:48.535
positive number and after that it doesn't change.

64
00:04:49.305 --> 00:04:51.055
Fixed cost never changes.

65
00:04:51.405 --> 00:04:53.095
Whether you are producing

66
00:04:53.435 --> 00:04:57.375
or you are not producing, you are going to incur this cost.

67
00:04:57.675 --> 00:05:01.015
Let us say for some reason you are operating a hotel

68
00:05:01.115 --> 00:05:02.935
or a restaurant, you know

69
00:05:02.955 --> 00:05:05.335
for some reason there is a cold wave outside,

70
00:05:05.755 --> 00:05:07.495
no one is coming to your restaurant.

71
00:05:08.795 --> 00:05:10.735
You have to incur this fixed cost.

72
00:05:13.145 --> 00:05:16.625
Tomorrow, let's say that owner has some family issues,

73
00:05:16.765 --> 00:05:19.105
that's why he doesn't want to open the shop,

74
00:05:19.365 --> 00:05:20.785
but manager will be paid

75
00:05:21.455 --> 00:05:24.545
whether you are serving one customer, 10 customer

76
00:05:24.565 --> 00:05:28.145
or no customer doesn't matter, manager will be paid.

77
00:05:29.245 --> 00:05:33.225
So manager is the salary to manager is fixed cost.

78
00:05:33.685 --> 00:05:35.625
But let us say that

79
00:05:36.245 --> 00:05:39.145
to open the restaurant you need one more

80
00:05:39.145 --> 00:05:40.785
person other than manager.

81
00:05:40.845 --> 00:05:42.545
You need a wait. So

82
00:05:42.845 --> 00:05:45.545
and wait you are able to hire on daily basis.

83
00:05:46.245 --> 00:05:49.705
If you are not opening the restaurant, you don't need

84
00:05:49.705 --> 00:05:52.425
to hire innovator, but if you're opening the restaurant,

85
00:05:52.565 --> 00:05:54.145
you need to hire one wait

86
00:05:54.965 --> 00:05:59.245
and that is going to be part of your quasi fixed cost.

87
00:05:59.475 --> 00:06:01.365
It's changing where your level

88
00:06:01.545 --> 00:06:04.925
of output is changing from zero to positive

89
00:06:05.185 --> 00:06:07.885
and that's the way quasi fixed cost is

90
00:06:07.885 --> 00:06:09.285
different from fixed cost.

91
00:06:09.665 --> 00:06:11.845
In these discussion, I will assume

92
00:06:12.115 --> 00:06:14.365
that either we have fixed cost

93
00:06:14.385 --> 00:06:16.285
or variable cost, you could say,

94
00:06:16.385 --> 00:06:19.765
but there are many businesses in which we have quasi fixed

95
00:06:19.765 --> 00:06:22.285
cost in electricity market, you know

96
00:06:22.305 --> 00:06:25.205
to start a generator you need huge energy

97
00:06:25.625 --> 00:06:29.005
and so to start a generator there is a huge cost involved.

98
00:06:29.145 --> 00:06:32.125
So that cost is a part of quasi fixed cost,

99
00:06:32.465 --> 00:06:36.285
but typically we assume for simplicity of understanding

100
00:06:36.635 --> 00:06:38.365
that either we have fixed cost

101
00:06:38.665 --> 00:06:41.485
or we have variable cost in the system

102
00:06:41.905 --> 00:06:45.285
for time being we will ignore quasi fixed cost.

103
00:06:45.945 --> 00:06:48.245
I'm going to come back to fixed cost

104
00:06:48.265 --> 00:06:49.925
and variable cost in a minute.

105
00:06:50.185 --> 00:06:54.605
But before that, let us understand what is average cost

106
00:06:54.905 --> 00:06:56.005
and marginal cost.

107
00:06:56.075 --> 00:06:57.965
This concept is also very important.

108
00:06:58.585 --> 00:07:02.085
So cost is again is a function of quantity.

109
00:07:03.685 --> 00:07:06.525
Sometime we are interested in knowing that how

110
00:07:07.645 --> 00:07:10.295
much is the cost in per unit term.

111
00:07:10.635 --> 00:07:14.815
So then we talk about average cost

112
00:07:15.475 --> 00:07:17.135
and average cost is nothing

113
00:07:17.515 --> 00:07:22.455
but C of Q divided by Q, no this is

114
00:07:22.995 --> 00:07:26.335
we can say total cost in numerator

115
00:07:26.795 --> 00:07:29.335
and in denominator we have quantity.

116
00:07:30.275 --> 00:07:33.415
So this is total cost divided by quantity

117
00:07:34.115 --> 00:07:36.095
as we are defining average cost.

118
00:07:36.195 --> 00:07:40.495
We can see here C of Q we just saw is equal

119
00:07:40.555 --> 00:07:45.175
to epsy, that is fixed cost and also a variable cost.

120
00:07:45.175 --> 00:07:47.975
That's a function of Q on both side.

121
00:07:48.035 --> 00:07:50.295
If we divide by Q,

122
00:07:52.365 --> 00:07:53.415
then what do we get?

123
00:07:53.805 --> 00:07:56.335
This side we get average cost.

124
00:07:56.885 --> 00:08:01.175
This has a you know sort form average cost A is coming from

125
00:08:01.175 --> 00:08:03.135
average and C is coming from cost.

126
00:08:03.365 --> 00:08:05.695
Average cost is a function of Q

127
00:08:06.835 --> 00:08:10.335
and then we have here FC by Q.

128
00:08:10.835 --> 00:08:15.775
So this is basically what we get rather than saying FC by Q,

129
00:08:16.155 --> 00:08:19.615
we can write this as average,

130
00:08:21.045 --> 00:08:22.895
average fixed cost

131
00:08:23.275 --> 00:08:26.855
and this is a function of q as Q changes.

132
00:08:27.445 --> 00:08:30.215
Average fixed cost would change, we will see it

133
00:08:30.735 --> 00:08:31.735
graphically in a minute.

134
00:08:32.165 --> 00:08:36.095
This is nothing but equal to fixed cost divided by q.

135
00:08:36.655 --> 00:08:37.815
Numerator is not changing.

136
00:08:37.995 --> 00:08:39.935
Let us say numerator is fixed at a hundred

137
00:08:40.395 --> 00:08:42.775
and Q is changing earlier it is 10

138
00:08:43.625 --> 00:08:46.815
let's say then the average fixed cost is 10.

139
00:08:47.475 --> 00:08:51.535
If total quantity is 20, average fixed cost is five.

140
00:08:51.555 --> 00:08:55.725
So we see that average fixed cost is changing with quantity.

141
00:08:56.195 --> 00:08:57.565
Therefore I say here

142
00:08:57.875 --> 00:09:01.605
that AEP C average fixed cost is a function of Q

143
00:09:02.105 --> 00:09:05.565
and so is variable average variable cost.

144
00:09:06.155 --> 00:09:07.925
What is average variable cost?

145
00:09:08.925 --> 00:09:11.365
Variable cost divided by Q.

146
00:09:12.225 --> 00:09:14.765
We can have instances where average

147
00:09:15.285 --> 00:09:16.765
variable cost is not changing.

148
00:09:17.265 --> 00:09:21.205
Let me give you an example that to produce one unit

149
00:09:21.865 --> 00:09:24.845
you need one rupe worth of raw material

150
00:09:26.005 --> 00:09:29.585
to produce 10 unit you need 10 rupe worth of raw material.

151
00:09:29.925 --> 00:09:34.665
So we see here in average variable cost, if so happens that

152
00:09:35.385 --> 00:09:39.105
C of VC of Q is equal

153
00:09:39.125 --> 00:09:40.625
to let's say simply Q.

154
00:09:42.335 --> 00:09:45.425
Then we get it as one and it is not changing.

155
00:09:45.565 --> 00:09:46.825
So you should keep in mind

156
00:09:47.135 --> 00:09:50.105
that fixed cost doesn't change with quantity.

157
00:09:51.105 --> 00:09:52.665
Variable cost changes with quantity

158
00:09:53.735 --> 00:09:56.905
average fixed cost definitely changes with quantity,

159
00:09:57.565 --> 00:10:00.745
but average variable cost may change

160
00:10:01.005 --> 00:10:03.905
or may not change with quantity it can remain same.

161
00:10:03.925 --> 00:10:06.225
We will see all these things graphically.

162
00:10:06.645 --> 00:10:10.905
So this is the way we can write this is average

163
00:10:12.095 --> 00:10:15.945
cost and average fixed cost and average variable cost.

164
00:10:16.725 --> 00:10:18.385
Now let us talk

165
00:10:18.475 --> 00:10:22.825
about Marginal cost.

166
00:10:24.095 --> 00:10:25.465
What is marginal cost?

167
00:10:26.185 --> 00:10:27.985
Colloquially, let me give you first

168
00:10:29.145 --> 00:10:31.425
a wrong definition.

169
00:10:32.075 --> 00:10:33.625
Wrong is too strong word

170
00:10:34.145 --> 00:10:36.785
a definition which is not very correct.

171
00:10:38.515 --> 00:10:41.375
It has but it's easier to understand.

172
00:10:42.185 --> 00:10:44.735
Later on I will give you a better definition,

173
00:10:44.845 --> 00:10:46.735
more appropriate definition.

174
00:10:47.115 --> 00:10:50.135
So let us say if you are producing Q unit,

175
00:10:52.015 --> 00:10:54.905
then your total cost is C of Q.

176
00:10:55.725 --> 00:10:57.945
If you produce Q plus one unit,

177
00:10:58.335 --> 00:11:01.785
your cost total cost goes up from C of Q

178
00:11:02.005 --> 00:11:03.385
to C of Q plus one.

179
00:11:03.925 --> 00:11:06.625
So to produce one additional unit,

180
00:11:09.325 --> 00:11:11.745
how much of cost do you incur?

181
00:11:13.245 --> 00:11:16.425
CQ plus one minus cq.

182
00:11:17.175 --> 00:11:19.305
This is what marginal cost is.

183
00:11:20.295 --> 00:11:24.945
It's easier to understand that marginal cost is a cost

184
00:11:25.975 --> 00:11:30.785
that you incur to produce one more unit of output.

185
00:11:33.085 --> 00:11:35.025
Why do I say it's not proper?

186
00:11:35.775 --> 00:11:38.505
Because this one is a very random number.

187
00:11:39.165 --> 00:11:42.305
Now if you think of any product, let's say RIN sa,

188
00:11:43.565 --> 00:11:45.785
you know you can have a hundred gram bar,

189
00:11:46.205 --> 00:11:51.145
you can have two 50 gram bar, you can have 50 gram bar

190
00:11:51.845 --> 00:11:55.365
so it can, so what do we mean by one?

191
00:11:55.745 --> 00:11:57.365
One is just to indicate

192
00:11:57.365 --> 00:12:00.965
that there is an increment in production.

193
00:12:01.425 --> 00:12:03.845
So rather than thinking in terms of one,

194
00:12:04.265 --> 00:12:06.325
let us think in term of edge

195
00:12:07.305 --> 00:12:10.405
we can say earlier Q is being produced,

196
00:12:10.915 --> 00:12:13.245
then the cost is C of Q

197
00:12:13.785 --> 00:12:16.445
and then Q plus H is being produced.

198
00:12:16.835 --> 00:12:21.525
Then C of Q plus H, how much is the difference?

199
00:12:22.895 --> 00:12:27.845
Difference is C of Q plus H minus

200
00:12:28.685 --> 00:12:31.645
C of Q, we should divide it by H.

201
00:12:32.065 --> 00:12:34.045
Why? Because H is a different,

202
00:12:34.065 --> 00:12:36.525
you know earlier also we were defining by one,

203
00:12:37.225 --> 00:12:40.925
let me say here that this is basically here

204
00:12:42.065 --> 00:12:45.205
in denominator we have Q plus one minus Q.

205
00:12:45.515 --> 00:12:48.405
This Q got canceled so we had one.

206
00:12:49.385 --> 00:12:53.645
So basically it is a rate of change here from Q we go

207
00:12:53.645 --> 00:12:54.765
to Q plus edge.

208
00:12:55.065 --> 00:12:58.245
So therefore the incremented of edge unit.

209
00:12:58.785 --> 00:13:03.035
So this is the rate

210
00:13:03.215 --> 00:13:05.115
of change in cost.

211
00:13:05.785 --> 00:13:10.315
What we say when this edge is very, very small we can make,

212
00:13:10.655 --> 00:13:13.875
we can start H equal to one, then HE equal to half,

213
00:13:13.875 --> 00:13:15.595
then H is equal to one by four

214
00:13:16.055 --> 00:13:18.515
and we can keep on decreasing this edge.

215
00:13:19.065 --> 00:13:23.355
What we get here is indicated by C dash Q,

216
00:13:23.725 --> 00:13:28.355
which is coming from calculus DC

217
00:13:28.415 --> 00:13:30.315
of Q divided by dq.

218
00:13:31.265 --> 00:13:35.115
This is your marginal cost.

219
00:13:42.155 --> 00:13:45.735
Let me take a moment to explain this

220
00:13:46.565 --> 00:13:47.855
with an example

221
00:13:49.145 --> 00:13:53.845
and we will also have a small discussion on

222
00:13:54.075 --> 00:13:55.685
what I just did.

223
00:13:55.905 --> 00:13:58.725
You know I used calculus, many of you knew calculus

224
00:13:59.025 --> 00:14:01.285
but some of you may have difficulty.

225
00:14:01.585 --> 00:14:02.885
So I will spend a minute

226
00:14:02.945 --> 00:14:06.975
or to talking about this notion

227
00:14:07.005 --> 00:14:08.455
that comes from calculus.

228
00:14:08.455 --> 00:14:09.535
People who are familiar.

229
00:14:09.675 --> 00:14:14.255
So skip it, okay, let us say that

230
00:14:15.075 --> 00:14:17.495
10 unit you are producing

231
00:14:17.955 --> 00:14:20.895
and your cost is coming out to be a hundred rupees.

232
00:14:21.275 --> 00:14:24.175
If you are producing 1111 unit

233
00:14:25.155 --> 00:14:28.535
and your cost is coming out to be 111,

234
00:14:29.485 --> 00:14:32.655
then we can say that the cost

235
00:14:32.755 --> 00:14:36.495
to produce one more unit at level of 10

236
00:14:37.445 --> 00:14:42.295
happens to be 111 minus a hundred, which is 11

237
00:14:43.035 --> 00:14:46.255
and this 11 is marginal cost.

238
00:14:47.315 --> 00:14:50.015
At least it is close to marginal cost.

239
00:14:50.875 --> 00:14:53.085
Why do I say close to marginal cost?

240
00:14:53.545 --> 00:14:55.485
Let us look at this entity.

241
00:14:56.305 --> 00:15:00.085
The cost is given as Q square.

242
00:15:00.945 --> 00:15:03.675
What does it mean that if you produce one unit,

243
00:15:05.205 --> 00:15:07.295
your cost is one rupe.

244
00:15:07.295 --> 00:15:10.655
If you produce two unit, your cost is four rupees.

245
00:15:10.655 --> 00:15:13.295
If you produce three unit, your cost is

246
00:15:14.285 --> 00:15:17.255
nine rupees y nine three a square is

247
00:15:17.445 --> 00:15:19.735
9 4 16 rupees.

248
00:15:19.995 --> 00:15:22.815
So from one to two the cost is three.

249
00:15:22.875 --> 00:15:25.415
So here marginal cost by earlier definition

250
00:15:26.155 --> 00:15:27.775
is coming out to be three.

251
00:15:28.525 --> 00:15:30.815
From here it's coming out to be five.

252
00:15:31.365 --> 00:15:33.855
From three to four it's coming out to be seven.

253
00:15:34.755 --> 00:15:38.775
But if we use calculus, so then we have

254
00:15:38.775 --> 00:15:39.935
to do the differentiation.

255
00:15:41.545 --> 00:15:45.155
Dell C by Dell Q and what we get is two Q.

256
00:15:45.975 --> 00:15:50.075
So at any point what two Q says

257
00:15:50.465 --> 00:15:52.875
that 1, 2, 3, 4.

258
00:15:52.945 --> 00:15:54.075
Here we have Q

259
00:15:54.655 --> 00:15:58.835
and here we have marginal cost.

260
00:15:59.295 --> 00:16:02.795
So when one unit you are producing marginal cost is two,

261
00:16:03.495 --> 00:16:07.115
it is four, it is six, it is eight.

262
00:16:07.735 --> 00:16:10.555
If you see there is you know difference

263
00:16:11.135 --> 00:16:13.115
at one you are getting one extra.

264
00:16:13.115 --> 00:16:14.355
Here you are getting two

265
00:16:14.655 --> 00:16:17.315
and here you are getting three at two you are getting four.

266
00:16:17.315 --> 00:16:18.835
Here you are getting five.

267
00:16:18.835 --> 00:16:20.715
Here at three you are getting six here.

268
00:16:21.025 --> 00:16:22.195
Here you are getting seven.

269
00:16:22.615 --> 00:16:27.435
So this definition is an approximation, this is

270
00:16:27.985 --> 00:16:31.595
more accurate definition that marginal cost

271
00:16:34.375 --> 00:16:37.155
Is the rate of change

272
00:16:39.655 --> 00:16:40.835
in total cost.

273
00:16:42.665 --> 00:16:46.955
Cost with respect to WRT indicates

274
00:16:46.985 --> 00:16:49.235
with respect to quantity.

275
00:16:53.495 --> 00:16:56.395
Now let us also understand, let us take this example

276
00:16:56.575 --> 00:16:59.115
and try to understand the graph.

277
00:17:00.615 --> 00:17:04.275
Let us say the graph is here.

278
00:17:04.665 --> 00:17:08.555
Here is Q square and here is Q. So this is one.

279
00:17:09.135 --> 00:17:11.675
Let us say this is 1.5

280
00:17:12.735 --> 00:17:16.515
and this is two and this is the way it goes.

281
00:17:16.785 --> 00:17:21.475
This is one, this is 2.25. This is four.

282
00:17:22.055 --> 00:17:23.755
So let us say one,

283
00:17:26.975 --> 00:17:31.525
2.25 and this is four.

284
00:17:32.505 --> 00:17:36.085
Now we can look at, you know, change jump from one to two.

285
00:17:36.705 --> 00:17:38.685
So this change is one

286
00:17:39.345 --> 00:17:43.805
and here correspondingly we are getting poor minus one.

287
00:17:43.805 --> 00:17:48.385
That is three slope is coming out to be three

288
00:17:48.485 --> 00:17:51.205
and that is the number that you are getting here.

289
00:17:53.365 --> 00:17:55.585
Now if you jump from one

290
00:17:55.585 --> 00:17:58.465
to 1.5 earlier you had this triangle,

291
00:18:01.485 --> 00:18:03.305
now you will have smaller triangle.

292
00:18:10.125 --> 00:18:12.015
This you will have this triangle.

293
00:18:12.515 --> 00:18:16.215
So here you have a change of

294
00:18:17.135 --> 00:18:19.705
0.5 from one to 1.5

295
00:18:20.325 --> 00:18:24.865
and here you have a change of 1 2 2 0.25.

296
00:18:25.245 --> 00:18:29.945
So that changes 1.25. So how much is the rate?

297
00:18:30.535 --> 00:18:35.505
Rate is 1.25 divided by 0.5, that is 2.5.

298
00:18:35.965 --> 00:18:39.065
So from three we have come to 2.5.

299
00:18:39.685 --> 00:18:43.545
If you look at using formula C

300
00:18:43.605 --> 00:18:48.185
of Q plus H is SQ plus H

301
00:18:48.575 --> 00:18:51.825
holy square by formula A plus B,

302
00:18:51.825 --> 00:18:56.105
holy square formula is a square plus two A B,

303
00:18:56.105 --> 00:18:59.465
that is two qh in this case plus hs square

304
00:19:00.085 --> 00:19:01.745
and here you have C of Q.

305
00:19:02.215 --> 00:19:06.305
This is Qs square, so C of Q plus H

306
00:19:06.915 --> 00:19:08.305
minus C of Q.

307
00:19:08.695 --> 00:19:12.505
What you are getting is two QH plus H square.

308
00:19:12.645 --> 00:19:16.305
Why this Q square and this Q square will be canceled

309
00:19:16.885 --> 00:19:20.145
and if you divide the whole thing by H, you divide here

310
00:19:20.165 --> 00:19:24.545
by H, what you get is basically two q plus edge

311
00:19:25.485 --> 00:19:29.225
and as in limit, you keep on decreasing edge,

312
00:19:29.935 --> 00:19:33.465
this edge will go to zero and you are left with two Q

313
00:19:33.725 --> 00:19:35.465
and that's what you are getting.

314
00:19:36.015 --> 00:19:39.425
This is exactly what you do in calculus. Okay?

315
00:19:39.845 --> 00:19:42.865
So marginal cost will come out

316
00:19:42.865 --> 00:19:45.345
to be two Q, not all the time.

317
00:19:45.725 --> 00:19:50.185
If C of Q is Q square, then it comes out to be two Q.

318
00:19:50.605 --> 00:19:53.175
If we can say simply

319
00:19:53.735 --> 00:19:56.015
marginal cost at Q is nothing

320
00:19:56.155 --> 00:19:59.135
but derivative of cost

321
00:19:59.765 --> 00:20:01.455
with respect to Q.

322
00:20:03.245 --> 00:20:06.375
Okay, so this is on marginal cost.

323
00:20:06.995 --> 00:20:11.655
Now let us try to understand relationship between average

324
00:20:11.995 --> 00:20:13.215
and marginal cost.

325
00:20:14.235 --> 00:20:17.135
For example, you are producing nine

326
00:20:17.185 --> 00:20:19.395
units, okay?

327
00:20:19.975 --> 00:20:24.155
And nine, the production of nine units will cost you,

328
00:20:24.255 --> 00:20:29.005
let us say 90 production

329
00:20:29.065 --> 00:20:31.045
of 10 units

330
00:20:32.405 --> 00:20:34.295
cost you 101.

331
00:20:34.765 --> 00:20:37.135
What is happening here average is

332
00:20:37.915 --> 00:20:41.135
if you calculate the average is 90 divided

333
00:20:41.235 --> 00:20:42.575
by nine, that is 10.

334
00:20:43.315 --> 00:20:47.485
And here average it at 10, level 100, one divided

335
00:20:47.665 --> 00:20:49.645
by 10, 10.1.

336
00:20:50.515 --> 00:20:55.405
What is happening? If you think of marginal cost here,

337
00:20:55.465 --> 00:21:00.045
and we use the definition that's easier to remember, that

338
00:21:01.205 --> 00:21:04.885
increase in cost if we produce one more unit that comes out

339
00:21:05.085 --> 00:21:07.205
to be 11, this 11

340
00:21:08.425 --> 00:21:10.365
we can say marginal cost happens

341
00:21:10.465 --> 00:21:12.565
to be greater than average cost.

342
00:21:13.105 --> 00:21:16.085
If marginal cost is greater than average cost,

343
00:21:16.575 --> 00:21:18.685
it'll increase the average cost.

344
00:21:18.815 --> 00:21:20.085
Think about it, what's happening?

345
00:21:20.865 --> 00:21:24.075
You are producing X unit.

346
00:21:25.965 --> 00:21:29.295
Each of these units on average costs A,

347
00:21:29.675 --> 00:21:33.735
so your total cost is a multiplied by X.

348
00:21:35.775 --> 00:21:39.585
Now you go from X

349
00:21:39.645 --> 00:21:41.065
to x plus one unit.

350
00:21:42.005 --> 00:21:46.985
Now it costs you more than eight to produce one extra unit.

351
00:21:47.365 --> 00:21:51.545
So that additional will pull the average up.

352
00:21:52.005 --> 00:21:53.105
That's what is happening.

353
00:21:53.325 --> 00:21:56.385
So if marginal cost is greater than average cost,

354
00:21:56.575 --> 00:21:58.385
then average cost would increase.

355
00:21:58.895 --> 00:22:02.505
Similarly, if marginal cost is less than average cost,

356
00:22:02.855 --> 00:22:05.785
then average cost would decrease.

357
00:22:07.285 --> 00:22:10.105
You can always do the maths, you can write it.

358
00:22:11.235 --> 00:22:12.455
Uh, you can make a table

359
00:22:12.595 --> 00:22:17.175
and see how is it happening Calculus wise, what we can do,

360
00:22:17.715 --> 00:22:22.295
we can say that average cost is C of Q

361
00:22:22.805 --> 00:22:24.135
divided by Q.

362
00:22:24.235 --> 00:22:25.935
That's the definition we have learned.

363
00:22:26.555 --> 00:22:31.055
Now we want to differentiate this average cost

364
00:22:31.565 --> 00:22:33.255
with respect to Q.

365
00:22:35.235 --> 00:22:38.855
By the way, if you are having difficulty with this, I will

366
00:22:40.005 --> 00:22:44.935
take some time and describe the calculus principle

367
00:22:44.935 --> 00:22:47.615
behind it during the discussion session.

368
00:22:47.785 --> 00:22:51.615
Don't be shy If many people are fine with it

369
00:22:51.635 --> 00:22:54.015
and very few people have difficulty,

370
00:22:54.495 --> 00:22:56.735
I will spend some extra time with these people

371
00:22:56.755 --> 00:23:00.015
who are facing difficulty and try to explain these things.

372
00:23:00.935 --> 00:23:02.455
I have no idea, uh,

373
00:23:02.455 --> 00:23:05.495
whether you are having any difficulty or not.

374
00:23:05.835 --> 00:23:07.695
So please feel free to write to me.

375
00:23:09.315 --> 00:23:11.895
So here, if you use the formula,

376
00:23:17.585 --> 00:23:19.005
How can we differentiate this?

377
00:23:19.265 --> 00:23:21.485
We have a formula. What is the formula?

378
00:23:22.105 --> 00:23:26.325
If you want to differentiate you by V with respect to X,

379
00:23:26.755 --> 00:23:30.685
what you are going to get, V, D, U by dx,

380
00:23:32.045 --> 00:23:35.725
UD, V by DX divided

381
00:23:35.865 --> 00:23:37.045
by VS square.

382
00:23:37.345 --> 00:23:42.125
So what you are going to get here is Q de C

383
00:23:42.145 --> 00:23:45.765
by Dell, Q minus U, S,

384
00:23:46.965 --> 00:23:48.245
C or cq.

385
00:23:48.465 --> 00:23:52.605
I'm sometime writing C as to represent cq.

386
00:23:53.305 --> 00:23:56.125
And then if you differentiate Q with respect to Q,

387
00:23:56.125 --> 00:24:01.005
you will get one divided by QS square, which is coming out

388
00:24:01.005 --> 00:24:05.485
to be DC by dq, divided by Q

389
00:24:06.295 --> 00:24:10.525
minus C of QQS square.

390
00:24:11.225 --> 00:24:15.525
You can pull out one by Q out, you will get DC

391
00:24:15.545 --> 00:24:20.085
by DQ minus CQ by Q

392
00:24:20.945 --> 00:24:22.085
if you pay attention.

393
00:24:22.475 --> 00:24:23.965
This is the marginal cost.

394
00:24:24.465 --> 00:24:27.885
So this is marginal cost minus

395
00:24:28.675 --> 00:24:29.765
average cost.

396
00:24:30.345 --> 00:24:33.645
So very clearly if from this formulation

397
00:24:34.545 --> 00:24:37.685
one can see we have already done non calculus version.

398
00:24:37.755 --> 00:24:39.485
Here we are doing the calculus version.

399
00:24:39.985 --> 00:24:43.925
If mc is greater than ac, it means

400
00:24:45.475 --> 00:24:47.525
this entity is positive.

401
00:24:48.025 --> 00:24:52.085
It means Dell by DA, C by DQ is positive

402
00:24:52.305 --> 00:24:54.085
and as Q increases,

403
00:24:55.555 --> 00:24:57.405
average cost will increase.

404
00:24:57.835 --> 00:25:00.725
Similarly, if Mc is less than ac,

405
00:25:02.145 --> 00:25:04.485
mc is less than ac, then

406
00:25:05.105 --> 00:25:09.485
as Q increases AC decreases y you can see from here

407
00:25:09.795 --> 00:25:13.685
that mc is less than AC means mc minus AC

408
00:25:13.865 --> 00:25:14.885
is a negative number.

409
00:25:15.385 --> 00:25:18.645
So what it says that as Q is increasing,

410
00:25:18.875 --> 00:25:20.645
average cost is decreasing.

411
00:25:20.645 --> 00:25:21.765
So that's what I am saying.

412
00:25:22.265 --> 00:25:26.925
And if mc is equal to ac, this is equal to zero.

413
00:25:27.385 --> 00:25:31.245
So it means a change in Q will not bring any change.

414
00:25:31.305 --> 00:25:35.085
In average cost, average cost remains the same.

415
00:25:35.465 --> 00:25:38.365
So this is the relationship between average

416
00:25:38.705 --> 00:25:40.685
and marginal cost.
